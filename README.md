CS 175 Final Project

In this project we simulate friction, velocity, and gravity. 
The velocity vector is represented by an arrow. The gravitational pull is between the two robots. To control the simulation, press the following: 

- ‘F’ to toggle friction mode
- ‘U’ to toggle gravity
- ‘V’ to toggle velocity mode on the selected object node (press 'p' to select a node)
- ‘g’to activate physics mode
